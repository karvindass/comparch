The LC-3b supports a rich, but lean, instruction set. Each 16-bit instruction consists of an opcode (bits[15:12]) plus 12 additional bits to specify the other information which is needed to carry out the work of that instruc- tion. Figure A summarizes the 14 different opcodes in the LC-3b and the specification of the remaining bits of each instruction. The 15th and 16th 4-bit opcodes are not specified, but are reserved for future use. Figure B shows the entire LC-3b instruction set.
